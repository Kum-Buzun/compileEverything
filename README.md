# compileEverything

Context: ServerFault question "[How to install packages on Linux or Solaris on non-default paths?](http://serverfault.com/questions/281810/how-to-install-packages-on-linux-or-solaris-on-non-default-paths)".  
Only answer I found: "compile everything"

Small bash script able to download, configure, build and install all librairies and usual apps needed in Linux or Solaris.  
That means gcc, Apache, SVN, Git, Python, Perl, all in the versions declared by http://sunfreeware.com/programlistsparc10.html

This doesn't modify your current environment, and can be executed in any subdirectory of your `$HOME`.
